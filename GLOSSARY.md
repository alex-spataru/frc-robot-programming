# Glossary

- **RoboRIO**: the onboard computer of the robot. It loads your robot code and manages all actuators and sensors.
- **Power Distribution Panel or PDP**: distributes electrical power to all the components of the robot that require it.
- **Pneumatics**: branch of Physics applied to technology that makes use of pressurized air or gas.
- **Controller Area Network or CAN**: a standard designed to allow micro-controllers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer. 
- **Pulse-width Modulation or PWM**: a technique used to encode information into a pulsing signal. It’s used in many industrial applications, such as controlling electrical motors or communicating with micro-controllers.
- **RSL**: acronym for “Robot Status Light”. It allows anyone near the robot to know if something is wrong with it by analyzing the blink rates of the light.
- **Actuator**: refers to any device that produces a mechanical movement

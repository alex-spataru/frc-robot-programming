# Glossary

## roboRIO

The on-board computer of the robot. It loads your robot code and manages attached controllers and devices. 

## PDP

Acronym for "Power Distribution Panel". It distributes electrical power to all the controllers and devices that need it.

## PCM

Device that contains all of the inputs and outputs required to operate 12V or 24V pneumatic solenoids and the on board compressor.

## Servo

A special kind of motor that allows precise control of angular position, velocity and acceleration.

## Pneumatic

Containing or operated by air or gas under pressure.

## RSL

Acronym for "Robot Status Light". It allows anyone near the robot to know if the robot is enabled and know if something is wrong with the robot.

## Digital I/O

Acronym for "Digital Input/Ouput". Its used for sensors and devices that send and recieve a boolean value (true/false).

## Analog I/O

Acronym for "Analog Input/Ouput". Its used for sensors and devices that send and receive data by measuring its voltage.

## CAN

Acronym for "Controller Area Network". Its a standard that allows micro-controllers to communicate with each other without the need of a host computer. Its used primarly by the automotive industry.

## DIO

Acronym for "Digital Input/Ouput". Its used for sensors and devices that send and recieve a boolean value (true/false).

## Analog Input

Acronym for "Analog Input/Ouput". Its used for sensors and devices that send and receive data by measuring its voltage.

## PWM

Acronym for "Pulse-width Modulation". A technique used to encode information into a pulsating electric signal. Its used in many industrial applications, such as controlling electrical motors or communicating with micro-controllers. Other uses include controlling computer components, such as CPU fans.

# FRC Robot Programming

This simple book is meant to get you started in FRC robot programming. 

As [Shaw's LPTH](http://learnpythonthehardway.org), this book teaches you to write code for FRC robots by building and establishing skills through practice and memorization.

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

- Understand how a FRC robot works
- Write and understand FRC robot software
- Create an efficient program for your robot
- Find and fix issues with your robot with your code
- Write different command modes for your robot. If you don’t understand this, you will understand later, trust me :)
- Understand the basics – and not so basics – of C++
- Be confident with programming anything you dream of

We sincerely hope that you enjoy reading this book and hopefully learn something from it.

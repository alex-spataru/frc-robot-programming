# How an FRC Robot Works

FRC robots are relatively easy to understand because FIRST enforces a set of standards that every FRC team needs to follow in order to compete. For example, you can only use a limited set of motor controllers and you may use only “official” or “approved” hardware for your robot.

### The RoboRIO

The RoboRIO is one of the most important components of a FRC robot; it’s a computer that loads your robot code automatically, makes available the Analog, Digital and PWM devices to the programmer and manages every attached device with your code.

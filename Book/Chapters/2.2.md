# C++ Basics

In this chapter, you will learn to write and understand basic C++ programs. 

You must pay a lot of attention to this section because it will lay the groundwork for you to understand increasingly complex programs and systems.

As noted before, **type** every line of code that you see. **Do not copy it *please!***

### Sections:

+ [Structure of a program](2.2.1.md)
    + This section will talk about how a C++ program is made and how it works at a very superficial level. 
+ [Variables](2.2.2.md)
    + This section will teach you to work with variables, such as numbers and strings. 
+ [Operators](2.2.3.md)
    + This section will talk about how to work with, modify and manage variables.  
+ [Methods and Functions](2.2.4.md)
    + This section will teach you to organize your code by dividing it into small, specialized sections, which are known as methods and functions. 
+ [Control Flow](2.2.5.md)
    + This section will teach you to make decisions in your program and will explain you the basic boolean logic.

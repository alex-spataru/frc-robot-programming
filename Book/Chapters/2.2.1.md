# Structure of a Program

As seen before, the best way to learn programming is by writing programs. One of the most common practices is to write a "Hello World" program, which simply prints "Hello World" in your screen.

First, create a new file with the following contents:

```cpp
// My first program!
#include <iostream>
    
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
    
Compile your program, when finished, the console screen should say:

    Hello World!
    
For reference, here is a screenshot:

# Analysis of our program

    1. // My first program!
    2. #include <iostream>
    3. 
    4. int main()
    5. {
    6.    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    7.    return 0;
    8. }
    
#### Line 1: <code>// My first program</code>

In C++, two slash signs mean that the rest of the line is a comment. Comments have no effect on the behaviour of the program.

Comments are used to explain what your code does to other programmers. Comments are also used to provide observations of a particular feature of your program, such as its license or documenation.

#### Line 2: <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code>

Lines beginning with a hash sign (#) are directives read and interpreted by what is known as the preprocessor. They are special lines interpreted before the compilation of the program itself begins. In this case, the directive #include <iostream>, instructs the preprocessor to include a section of standard C++ code, known as header iostream, that allows to perform standard input and output operations, such as writing the output of this program (Hello World) to the screen.

#### Line 3: Blank line

A blank line has no effect on the behaviour of the program. They are used only for readibility purposes.

#### Line 4: <code>int main()</code>

This line initiates the declaration of a function. Functions are sections of a program that perform a specific operation, such as launching your program or adding two numbers.

Functions will be discussed in detail in a later chapter, but essentially, their definition is introduced with a succession of a type <code>(int)</code>, a name (<code>main</code>), and a pair of parentheses (<code>()</code>), optionally including parameters.

The function named <code>main</code> is a special function in all C++ programs; it is the function called when the program is run. The execution of all C++ programs begins with the main function, regardless of where the function is actually located within the code.

#### Lines 5 and 8: <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>

The open brace (<code>{</code>) at line <code>5</code> indicates the beginning of main's function definition, and the closing brace (<code>}</code>) at line <code>7</code>, indicates its end. Everything between these braces is the function's body that defines what happens when <code>main</code> is called. All functions use braces to indicate the beginning and end of their definitions.

#### Line 6: <code>std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;</code>

This line is a C++ statement. A statement is an expression that can actually produce some effect. It is the meat of a program, specifying its actual behavior. Statements are executed in the same order that they appear within a function's body.

This statement has three parts: First, <code>std::cout</code>, which identifies the standard character output device (usually, this is the computer screen). Second, the insertion operator (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>), which indicates that what follows is inserted into <code>std::cout</code>. Finally, a sentence within quotes ("Hello world!"), is the content inserted into the standard output.

Notice that the statement ends with a semicolon (<code>;</code>). This character marks the end of the statement, just as the period ends a sentence in English. All C++ statements must end with a semicolon character. One of the most common syntax errors in C++ is forgetting to end a statement with a semicolon.

![RoboRIO with Labels](http://khengineering.github.io/RoboRio/controls/Images/roborio.jpg)

The roboRIO is the main robot controller used for FRC 2015. The roboRIO includes a dual-core ARM Cortexâ„¢-A9 processor and FPGA which runs both trusted elements for control and safety as well as team-generated code. Integrated controller I/O includes a variety of communication protocols (Ethernet, USB, CAN, SPI, I2C, and serial) as well as PWM, servo, digital I/O, and analog I/O channels used to connect to robot peripherals for sensing and control.The roboRIO should connect to the dedicated 12V port on the Power Distribution Panel for power. Wired communication is available via USB or Ethernet. Detailed information on the roboRIO can be found in the [roboRIO User Manual](https://decibel.ni.com/content/servlet/JiveServlet/download/30419-60-90614/roboRIO%20User%20Manual.pdf).

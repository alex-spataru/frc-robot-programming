# General Hardware Overview

This section presents the 2015 control system general hardware. This document is very important for any member of the engineering area of your team, as it summarizes most of the components that your robot will make use of.

This contents of this document come from the [official WPILib documentation](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/24166/l/144968-2015-frc-control-system-hardware-overview).

### The roboRIO

![RoboRIO with Labels](http://khengineering.github.io/RoboRio/controls/Images/roborio.jpg)

The roboRIO is the main robot controller used for FRC 2015. The roboRIO includes a dual-core ARM Cortex™-A9 processor and FPGA which runs both trusted elements for control and safety as well as team-generated code. Integrated controller I/O includes a variety of communication protocols (Ethernet, USB, CAN, SPI, I2C, and serial) as well as PWM, servo, digital I/O, and analog I/O channels used to connect to robot peripherals for sensing and control.The roboRIO should connect to the dedicated 12V port on the Power Distribution Panel for power. Wired communication is available via USB or Ethernet. Detailed information on the roboRIO can be found in the [roboRIO User Manual](https://decibel.ni.com/content/servlet/JiveServlet/download/30419-60-90614/roboRIO%20User%20Manual.pdf).

### The Power Distribution Panel (PDP)

![PDP with Labels](http://khengineering.github.io/RoboRio/controls/Images/pdpinfo.png)

The Power Distribution Panel (PDP) is designed to distribute power from a 12VDC battery to various robot components through auto-resetting circuit breakers and a small number of special function fused connections. The PDP provides 8 output pairs rated for 40A continuous current and 8 pairs rated for 30A continuous current. The PDP provides dedicated 12V connectors for the roboRIO, as well as connectors for the Voltage Regulator Module and Pneumatics Control Module. It also includes a CAN interface for logging current, temperature, and battery voltage. For more detailed information, see the [PDP User Manual](http://crosstheroadelectronics.com/control_system.html).

### Pneumatics Control Module (PCM)

The PCM is a device that contains all of the inputs and outputs required to operate 12V or 24V pneumatic solenoids and the on board compressor. The PCM is enabled/disabled by the roboRIO over the CAN interface. The PCM contains an input for the pressure sensor and will control the compressor automatically when the robot is enabled and a solenoid has been created in the code. The device also collects diagnostic information such as solenoid states, pressure switch state, and compressor state. The module includes diagnostic LED’s for both CAN and the individual solenoid channels. For more information see the [PCM User Manual](http://crosstheroadelectronics.com/control_system.html).

### D-Link DAP-1522 Rev B

The D-Link DAP-1522 Rev B robot radio is used to provide wireless communication functionality to the robot. The device can be configured as an Access Point for direct connection of a laptop for use at home. It can also be configured as a bridge for use on the field. The robot radio should be powered by one of the 5V outputs on the VRM and connected to the roboRIO controller over Ethernet. For more information, see [programming your radio for home use](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/144986?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=13503) and the [D-Link DAP1522 Support Page](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/144986?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=13503).

### 120A Circuit Breaker

The 120A Main Circuit Breaker serves two roles on the robot: the main robot power switch and a protection device for downstream robot wiring and components. The 120A circuit breaker is wired to the positive terminals of the robot battery and PDP.

### Robot Battery

The power supply for an FRC robot is a single 12V 18Ah battery. The batteries used for FRC are sealed lead acid batteries capable of meeting the high current demands of an FRC robot. For more information, see the Datasheets for the [MK ES17-12](http://www.mkbattery.com/images/ES17-12.pdf) and [Enersys NP18-12](http://www.enersys.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=488). Note that other battery part numbers may be legal, consult the 2015 FRC Manual for a complete list.

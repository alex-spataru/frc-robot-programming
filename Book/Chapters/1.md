# Robot Components

One of the most important things in programming is that you need to understand what are you programming. If you want to write a game, you need to understand how a game works. If you want to write software for a robot, you need how the robot works.

FRC robots are easy to understand because FIRST enforces a set of standards for all FRC teams. In most cases, you can only use “official” or “approved” hardware for your robot.

There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, you may use "unofficial" sensors to enhance the functionality of your robot. Our 2015 robot uses [Rockwell's VisiSight](http://ab.rockwellautomation.com/Sensors-Switches/Miniature-Photoelectric-Sensors/VisiSight-Photoelectric-Sensors) sensors to avoid jamming the elevator system.

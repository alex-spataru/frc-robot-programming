# Compilers

The tools needed to follow these tutorials are a computer and a compiler toolchain able to compile C++ code and build the programs to run on it.

Installing the development tools is easy, just follow the steps for your operating system:

### ➠ Mac OS X

Download and install "Xcode" from the App Store. Please take note that this may take forever, as the download is large (~3 GB on total).

While downloading Xcode, download CodeBlocks [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/13.12/MacOS/CodeBlocks-13.12-mac.zip/download). Before doing any actual programming, be sure to open Xcode and accept the license agreement, it will configure and install GCC on your Mac.

After you have everything configured, follow [this](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/introduction/codeblocks/) tutorial in order to verify that everything is working.

### ➠  Linux

Run the following command from a terminal window:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential codeblocks
    
After the command finishes, follow [this](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/introduction/codeblocks/) tutorial in order to verify that everything is working.

### ➠  Windows

[Download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/13.12/Windows/codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup-TDM-GCC-481.exe) and install CodeBlocks. I will be using this option for the tutorials.

After the installation of CodeBlocks is complete, follow [this](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/introduction/devcpp/) tutorial to check that everything works correctly.

### ➠  Some tips

If everything went well, you should be able to jump to the [next chapter](3.2.md) and start coding right away.

Before you start the next chapter, I recommend you to get comfortable using the Terminal or Command Prompt. Especially if you are using Mac or Linux. Here are some articles to get you started:

- For Windows [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kboexp3QiUg)
- For Mac OS X, click [here](http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/utilities-how-to/how-to-use-terminal-the-basics/)
- For GNU/Linux, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uabfu_RJLyg)

Its not necessary to be a CLI expert or become a command line junkie. In fact, you can skip those tutorials if you want. The idea is to know how to open a terminal, how to navigate your system with it and how to write a command.

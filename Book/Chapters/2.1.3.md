# Installing the Development Tools

If you are using Linux or Mac OS X, installing the tools for developing C++ is very easy. On the other hand if you are using Microsoft Windows, there could be some additional steps to be taken...

### ➠ Mac OS X

Simply download and install "Xcode" from the App Store. Please take note that this may take forever, as the download is very large (~3 GB on total).

While downloading Xcode, take some time to search for a programmer's text editor for Mac. There are plenty of options out there, such as Text Wrangler, Coda or TextEdit. If you want a free and lightweight text editor, you would make me very happy by downloading [Thunderpad](http://github.com/alex-spataru/thunderpad), my own programmer's text editor.

### ➠  Linux

Simple run the following command from a terminal window:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

As for the text editor, most distributions come with very descent text editor, such as GEdit or Kate.

### ➠  Windows

Now, here comes the hard part my friends. You have plenty of options regarding Windows, however, both of them require you to do some little hacking around in order to get C++ working.

**If you like Microsoft (big download!)**

- [Download](http://microsoft.com) and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2013. The download may take a while (~ 2 GB).

**If you prefer open source software**
- Install a programmer's text editor, such as [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.com) or [Thunderpad](http://github.com/alex-spataru/thunderpad)
- Download and install the TDM GCC Compiler Suite from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/).

### ➠  Some tips

If everything went well, you should be able to jump to the [next chapter](3.2.md) and start coding right away.

Before you start the next chapter, I strongly recommend you to get confortable using the Terminal or Command Line. Here are some articles to get you started:

- For Windows [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kboexp3QiUg)
- For Mac OS X, click [here](http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/utilities-how-to/how-to-use-terminal-the-basics/)
- For GNU/Linux, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uabfu_RJLyg)

Its not necessary to be a CLI expert or become a command line junkie. In fact, you can skip those tutorials if you want. The idea is to know how to open a terminal, how to navigate your system with it and how to write a command.

Of course, I would recommend you to avoid being "scared" of the computer. Believe it or not, there are many people that have a fear of screwing something up when they see a command prompt. Believe me, its really difficult to do any real harm to your computer while playing with the command line, unless you really want to screw your computer that is ;)

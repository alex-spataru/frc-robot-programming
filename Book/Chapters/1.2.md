# The Power Distribution Panel (PDP)

The PDP is in charge of sending electrical power to all the robot components. All FRC teams are enforced to use this panel for safety reasons. Every component that requires electricity must be connected to the PDP. If thereâ€™s a short on the robot, the PDP will trip the corresponding breaker automatically.

# Robot Components

One of the most important things in programming is that you need to understand what are you programming. If you want to write a game, you need to understand how a game works. If you want to write software for a robot, you need how the robot works.

FRC robots are easy to understand because FIRST enforces a set of standards for all FRC teams. In most cases, you can only use “official” or “approved” hardware for your robot.

There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, you may use "unofficial" sensors to enhance the functionality of your robot. Our 2015 robot uses [Rockwell's VisiSight](http://ab.rockwellautomation.com/Sensors-Switches/Miniature-Photoelectric-Sensors/VisiSight-Photoelectric-Sensors) sensors to avoid jamming the elevator system.

### The roboRIO

![RoboRIO with Labels](http://khengineering.github.io/RoboRio/controls/Images/roborio.jpg)

The roboRIO is the main robot controller used for FRC 2015. The roboRIO includes a dual-core ARM Cortex™-A9 processor and FPGA which runs both trusted elements for control and safety as well as team-generated code. Integrated controller I/O includes a variety of communication protocols (Ethernet, USB, CAN, SPI, I2C, and serial) as well as PWM, servo, digital I/O, and analog I/O channels used to connect to robot peripherals for sensing and control.The roboRIO should connect to the dedicated 12V port on the Power Distribution Panel for power. Wired communication is available via USB or Ethernet. Detailed information on the roboRIO can be found in the [roboRIO User Manual](https://decibel.ni.com/content/servlet/JiveServlet/download/30419-60-90614/roboRIO%20User%20Manual.pdf).

### The Power Distribution Panel (PDP)

The Power Distribution Panel (PDP) is designed to distribute power from a 12VDC battery to various robot components through auto-resetting circuit breakers and a small number of special function fused connections. The PDP provides 8 output pairs rated for 40A continuous current and 8 pairs rated for 30A continuous current. The PDP provides dedicated 12V connectors for the roboRIO, as well as connectors for the Voltage Regulator Module and Pneumatics Control Module. It also includes a CAN interface for logging current, temperature, and battery voltage. For more detailed information, see the [PDP User Manual](http://crosstheroadelectronics.com/control_system.html).

### Pneumatics Control Module (PCM)

The PCM is a device that contains all of the inputs and outputs required to operate 12V or 24V pneumatic solenoids and the on board compressor. The PCM is enabled/disabled by the roboRIO over the CAN interface. The PCM contains an input for the pressure sensor and will control the compressor automatically when the robot is enabled and a solenoid has been created in the code. The device also collects diagnostic information such as solenoid states, pressure switch state, and compressor state. The module includes diagnostic LED’s for both CAN and the individual solenoid channels. For more information see the [PCM User Manual](http://crosstheroadelectronics.com/control_system.html).

### D-Link DAP-1522 Rev B

The D-Link DAP-1522 Rev B robot radio is used to provide wireless communication functionality to the robot. The device can be configured as an Access Point for direct connection of a laptop for use at home. It can also be configured as a bridge for use on the field. The robot radio should be powered by one of the 5V outputs on the VRM and connected to the roboRIO controller over Ethernet. For more information, see [Programming your radio for home use](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/144986?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=13503) and the [D-Link DAP1522 Support Page](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/144986?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=13503).

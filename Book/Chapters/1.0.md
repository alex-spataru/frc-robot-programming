# Robot Components

One of the most important things in programming is that you need to understand what are you programming. If you want to write a game, you need to understand how a game works. If you want to write software for a robot, you need to know how the robot works.

FRC robots are easy to understand because FIRST enforces a set of standards for all FRC teams. In most cases, you may only use “official” or “approved” hardware for your robot.

There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, you may use "unofficial" sensors to enhance the functionality of your robot. Our 2015 robot uses [Rockwell's VisiSight](http://ab.rockwellautomation.com/Sensors-Switches/Miniature-Photoelectric-Sensors/VisiSight-Photoelectric-Sensors) sensors to avoid jamming the elevator system.

## General Hardware Overview

This section presents the 2015 control system general hardware. This document is very important for any member of the engineering area of your team, as it summarizes most of the components that your robot will make use of.

This contents of this document come from the [official WPILib documentation](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/24166/l/144968-2015-frc-control-system-hardware-overview).

### The roboRIO

![RoboRIO with Labels](http://khengineering.github.io/RoboRio/controls/Images/roborio.jpg)

The roboRIO is the main robot controller used for FRC 2015. The roboRIO includes a dual-core ARM Cortex™-A9 processor and FPGA which runs both trusted elements for control and safety as well as team-generated code. Integrated controller I/O includes a variety of communication protocols (Ethernet, USB, CAN, SPI, I2C, and serial) as well as PWM, servo, digital I/O, and analog I/O channels used to connect to robot peripherals for sensing and control.The roboRIO should connect to the dedicated 12V port on the Power Distribution Panel for power. Wired communication is available via USB or Ethernet. Detailed information on the roboRIO can be found in the [roboRIO User Manual](https://decibel.ni.com/content/servlet/JiveServlet/download/30419-60-90614/roboRIO%20User%20Manual.pdf).

### The Power Distribution Panel (PDP)

![PDP with Labels](http://khengineering.github.io/RoboRio/controls/Images/pdpinfo.png)

The Power Distribution Panel (PDP) is designed to distribute power from a 12VDC battery to various robot components through auto-resetting circuit breakers and a small number of special function fused connections. The PDP provides 8 output pairs rated for 40A continuous current and 8 pairs rated for 30A continuous current. The PDP provides dedicated 12V connectors for the roboRIO, as well as connectors for the Voltage Regulator Module and Pneumatics Control Module. It also includes a CAN interface for logging current, temperature, and battery voltage. For more detailed information, see the [PDP User Manual](http://crosstheroadelectronics.com/control_system.html).

### Pneumatics Control Module (PCM)

![PCM with Labels](http://khengineering.github.io/RoboRio/Images/pcminfo.png)

The PCM is a device that contains all of the inputs and outputs required to operate 12V or 24V pneumatic solenoids and the on board compressor. The PCM is enabled/disabled by the roboRIO over the CAN interface. The PCM contains an input for the pressure sensor and will control the compressor automatically when the robot is enabled and a solenoid has been created in the code. The device also collects diagnostic information such as solenoid states, pressure switch state, and compressor state. The module includes diagnostic LED’s for both CAN and the individual solenoid channels. For more information see the [PCM User Manual](http://crosstheroadelectronics.com/control_system.html).

### D-Link DAP-1522 Rev B

![D-Link DAP-1522 Rev B](http://cdn3.volusion.com/vyfsn.knvgw/v/vspfiles/photos/am-0839-2.jpg?1420269442)

The D-Link DAP-1522 Rev B robot radio is used to provide wireless communication functionality to the robot. The device can be configured as an Access Point for direct connection of a laptop for use at home. It can also be configured as a bridge for use on the field. The robot radio should be powered by one of the 5V outputs on the VRM and connected to the roboRIO controller over Ethernet. For more information, see [programming your radio for home use](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/144986?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=13503) and the [D-Link DAP1522 Support Page](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/144986?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=13503).

### 120A Circuit Breaker

![Breaker](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81XXM76GLCL._SX355_.jpg)

The 120A Main Circuit Breaker serves two roles on the robot: the main robot power switch and a protection device for downstream robot wiring and components. The 120A circuit breaker is wired to the positive terminals of the robot battery and PDP.

### Robot Battery

![Robot Battery](http://cdn3.volusion.com/vyfsn.knvgw/v/vspfiles/photos/am-0844-2.jpg?1420269442)

The power supply for an FRC robot is a single 12V 18Ah battery. The batteries used for FRC are sealed lead acid batteries capable of meeting the high current demands of an FRC robot. For more information, see the Datasheets for the [MK ES17-12](http://www.mkbattery.com/images/ES17-12.pdf) and [Enersys NP18-12](http://www.enersys.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=488). Note that other battery part numbers may be legal, consult the 2015 FRC Manual for a complete list.

### The motor controllers

In FRC robots (and most robots), you don't have access to the motor actuators directly. You need to wire your motor to a Talon, Jaguar or Victor controller to control it.

As of May 2015, the allowed motor controllers for FRC teams are:

![Motor Controllers](http://khengineering.github.io/RoboRio/Images/motorcontrollers.png)

The primary differences between the motor controllers above are:

- **Safety**: air intakes posses a serious security threat to your robot. Avoid them when possible.
- **Size**: depending on your robot, you may appreciate the smaller sized motor controllers.
- **Output**: each motor controller has a different way to control a motor. The best way to test this is by plugging in a motor and testing its performance with each controller.
- **Temperature efficiency**: older models, such as the Jaguar and Victor 888 controllers, may take more time to cool down than newer controllers.

Our team prefers to use the Victor SP controllers for secondary subsystems, such as the elevator or rollers. We use the Talon SRX controllers for primary subsystems, such as the drive system.
